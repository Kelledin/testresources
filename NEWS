testresources release notes
---------------------------


IN DEVELOPMENT
--------------

  CHANGES:

    * testresources now depends on pyunit3k. You can still use testresources
      without using pyunit3k directly. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Calling finishedWith on a dirty resource now cleans that resource.
      (Jonathan Lange)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Many more docstrings. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Expanded README. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Expanded TODO. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Started keeping a NEWS file! (Jonathan Lange)

  API CHANGES:

    * OptimisingTestSuite has been renamed to OptimizingTestSuite.
      (Jonathan Lange)

    * OptimizingTestSuite.adsorbSuite has been renamed to addTestFlat.
      (Jonathan Lange)

    * ResourcedTestCase.setUpResources and tearDownResources are now instance
      methods, not static methods. (Jonathan Lange)

    * All methods on TestResource are now instance methods, and thus tests
      should use instances of TestResource subclasses, not the classes
      themselves. (Jonathan Lange)

    * TestResource.setResource has been renamed to _setResource.
      (Jonathan Lange)

    * SampleTestResource has been removed. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ResourcedTestCase will now look for resources in the 'resources'
      attribute, rather than the '_resources' attribute. (Jonathan Lange)

    * TestResource subclasses should override makeResource and cleanResource
      where they previously overrode _makeResource and _cleanResource.
      (Jonathan Lange)

  INTERNALS:

    * A lot of the tests have been split up into smaller tests. Others have
      been refactored. (Jonathan Lange)

    * OptimizingTestSuite has been refactored internally so that the way we
      switch active resources and determine the cost of switching is more
      obvious. (Jonathan Lange)
